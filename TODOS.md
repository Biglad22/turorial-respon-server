### **Week 1: Core Frontend & Backend Fundamentals**

#### **Day 1: January 7**
- **Frontend**: Advanced CSS: Flexbox, Grid, and responsive design principles.
- **Backend**: Introduction to Node.js and Express.js; setting up a basic server.
- **Project**: Build a responsive "About Me" page with a contact form. Use Express.js to create a simple route that displays a JSON response when the form is submitted.

#### **Day 2: January 8**
- **Frontend**: CSS Animations and Transitions.
- **Backend**: Middleware basics in Express.js (what it is and how it works).
- **Project**: Enhance the "About Me" page with animations. Add middleware to log request details whenever a user accesses the page.

#### **Day 3: January 9**
- **Frontend**: Advanced JavaScript: Closures, Promises, and introducing `async/await`.
- **Backend**: Understanding RESTful APIs and designing endpoints in Express.js.
- **Project**: Build a weather app. Fetch weather data from a public API on the frontend, and use Express.js to serve the data via a custom API route.

#### **Day 4: January 10**
- **Frontend**: Working with LocalStorage, SessionStorage, and IndexedDB.
- **Backend**: Handling GET and POST requests in Express.js using `async/await`.
- **Project**: Create a to-do list app where tasks are saved in LocalStorage and synced with the backend using POST and GET requests.

#### **Day 5: January 11**
- **Frontend**: Introduction to WebSockets for real-time updates.
- **Backend**: Setting up WebSocket communication with Socket.IO; event-driven programming.
- **Project**: Build a real-time chat app with WebSockets. Show messages instantly between users connected to the app.

#### **Day 6: January 12**
- **Frontend**: TypeScript basics for React or Vue.js.
- **Backend**: Error handling in Express.js (try-catch, error middleware) and introduction to events with Node.js EventEmitter.
- **Project**: Build a form with frontend TypeScript validation. On the backend, handle and log errors for invalid form submissions, and emit events for specific server actions (e.g., form submission).

#### **Day 7: January 13**
- **Frontend**: Advanced React/Vue.js patterns: Custom hooks or Composition API.
- **Backend**: Setting up MongoDB or Firebase for database integration.
- **Project**: Build a book collection app with a database. Users can add books via the frontend and retrieve them dynamically from the backend.
